# Dev_Setup
Setup Development Environment

#Assignment: Setting Up Your Developer Environment

#Objective:
This assignment aims to familiarize you with the tools and configurations necessary to set up an efficient developer environment for software engineering projects. Completing this assignment will give you the skills required to set up a robust and productive workspace conducive to coding, debugging, version control, and collaboration.

#Tasks:

1. Select Your Operating System (OS):
   Choose an operating system that best suits your preferences and project requirements. Download and Install Windows 11. https://www.microsoft.com/software-download/windows11

2. Install a Text Editor or Integrated Development Environment (IDE):
   Select and install a text editor or IDE suitable for your programming languages and workflow. Download and Install Visual Studio Code. https://code.visualstudio.com/Download
3. Set Up Version Control System:
   Install Git and configure it on your local machine. Create a GitHub account for hosting your repositories. Initialize a Git repository for your project and make your first commit. https://github.com

4. Install Necessary Programming Languages and Runtimes:
  Instal Python from http://wwww.python.org programming language required for your project and install their respective compilers, interpreters, or runtimes. Ensure you have the necessary tools to build and execute your code.

5. Install Package Managers:
   If applicable, install package managers like pip (Python).

6. Configure a Database (MySQL):
   Download and install MySQL database. https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/windows/installer/5.7.html

7. Set Up Development Environments and Virtualization (Optional):
   Consider using virtualization tools like Docker or virtual machines to isolate project dependencies and ensure consistent environments across different machines.

8. Explore Extensions and Plugins:
   Explore available extensions, plugins, and add-ons for your chosen text editor or IDE to enhance functionality, such as syntax highlighting, linting, code formatting, and version control integration.

9. Document Your Setup:
    Create a comprehensive document outlining the steps you've taken to set up your developer environment. Include any configurations, customizations, or troubleshooting steps encountered during the process. 

#Deliverables:
- Document detailing the setup process with step-by-step instructions and screenshots where necessary.
- A GitHub repository containing a sample project initialized with Git and any necessary configuration files (e.g., .gitignore).
- A reflection on the challenges faced during setup and strategies employed to overcome them.

#Submission:
Submit your document and GitHub repository link through the designated platform or email to the instructor by the specified deadline.

#Evaluation Criteria:**
- Completeness and accuracy of setup documentation.
- Effectiveness of version control implementation.
- Appropriateness of tools selected for the project requirements.
- Clarity of reflection on challenges and solutions encountered.
- Adherence to submission guidelines and deadlines.

Note: Feel free to reach out for clarification or assistance with any aspect of the assignment.




# Task 1: Operating System installation
      well i tried to doenload the latest version of windows ie windows 11 by copying the link  https://www.microsoft.com/software-download/windows11 and pasting in my browser but my machine wasn't compatible for two reasons which are 
                  a)my PC's processor aren't supported by windows 11
                  b)TPM isn't supported and enabled in my pc
         this crippled my actions of installing windows 11 hence i decide to you my windows 10 for the time.


# Task 2: IDE installation
        these step seemed to be among the easiest of them all. I managed to install my visual studio using the link provided ie (https://code.visualstudio.com/Download)
          this image ![alt text](image.png) shows the vs code i downloaded. I just had to ensure its location is identified and install it.

# Task 3: setting up a Version Control System
   
    i have previously interructed with Github account but not git bash. i installedthe whole load of git. i just had to type git downloads in my browser and select the specified for my machine as shown in the image ![alt text](image-1.png) 
    after installing i had to run my gitbash to ensure the git is the latest as shown ![alt text](image-3.png)

# Task 4: install necessary programming language
   
    For the project, python was the necessary language. i used the link: https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/ to download latest version for windows. I downloaded using the link highlighted in red: ![alt text](image-4.png) 
    I then opened my VS code and install all python extensions for easy working as shown ![alt text](image-5.png)

# Task 5: Install Package Managers
    
    having git bash in my device this activity seemed easier. all i had to do was to prompt the git bash shell the command "pip install <package-name> " in the <package-name> section i had to pass the pacjage such as django.

# Task 6: Configure a Database (MySQL)
   
   For data: storage,access and management we need databases . To download search for  dev.mysql.com/downloads/installer/
   download the highligted one as shown in the image ![alt text](image-6.png)
   during the installation ensure you choose custom at the start so as to download not only mysql but also extensions such as workbench and server ![alt text](image-7.png)
   After choosing install as by executing as shown ![alt text](image-8.png)
   in the type and networking section ![alt text](image-11.png)
   click next and enter password to be used whenever one needs authentication 
   create a password easier to remember and also should be strong to avoid cracking

   
# Task 7:virtual Environments
I used a virtual environments that comes embedded with python. On top of that i used django  that is installed with the prompts "python -m pip install django"
i also installed python pillow by running the code "python -m pip install pillow"



 
 
 
 
 
 # I had some couple of challenges%%
1. some of them were ofcourse network but this was easily solve. While download an item network decides to misbehave through disconnection. The best way was to search for a different internet connection quickly

2. installing windows 11 seemed harder for my machine due to two specific reasons according to the health checker which  were : a.]my PC's processor aren't supported by windows 11
                  b)TPM isn't supported and enabled in my pc

to curb the problems i had to accept the impossibles for now and use the current which is windows 10

3. My installation seemed quite a process of which in case you missed any might be fatal in future. i had not included  a workbench at first so i had to download it later which i did. 
I almost added a weaker password but remmebering what effects of cracking by crackers ,i immediately chipped in a stronger one.
